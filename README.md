# well.js

Well.js is lightweight [Promises/A+](http://promises-aplus.github.com/promises-spec) implemention. It evolved from [when](https://github.com/cujojs/when)-1.8.1 for  getting higher performance. The article [Promises/A+ Performance Hits You Should Be Aware Of](http://thanpol.as/javascript/promises-a-performance-hits-you-should-be-aware-of/) described the benchmark defference of some common promise implementations. In addition, well.js also provide:

* Native canclable deferrd
* Throw exception for uncaught error

It passes the [Promises/A+ Test Suite](https://github.com/promises-aplus/promises-tests), is [very fast](https://github.com/cujojs/promise-perf-tests#test-results) and compact, and has no external dependencies.
